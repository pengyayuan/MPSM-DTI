# MPSM-DTI
Prediction of Drug-Target Interaction via Machine Learning based on Chemical Structure and Protein Sequence
RDKit-Morgan.py is used to calculated Morgan fingerprints.
Morgan-model.py is used to training and test models.
using Morgan-model.py, you can training your data and save your model with pickle format.
After get the pickle file, you can use the model-predict.py to predict your compound-target interactions.
